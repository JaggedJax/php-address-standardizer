Address Standardization Solution (PHP Edition)

Formats a Delivery Address Line according to the United States Postal
Service's Addressing Standards.

The heart of the program is in addr-tx.inc.

One demonstration of how to process address lines is in
addr-tx_ex-standard.php.  A sample of creating an HTML option list
of states is in addr-tx_ex-list.php.

Unit tests are in the Test directory.
